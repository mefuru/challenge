My solution is implemented in JS, and I'm using two libraries. Express and socket.io for familiarity's sake.

Note

TODO: Error handling - quite easy with promises

TODO: The solution to fieldC isn't correct!

I think it shouldn't be too tough to solve using regex (!) but I can't figure it out right now. Bit rusty with the language.
